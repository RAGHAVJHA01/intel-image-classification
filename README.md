# intel-image-classification

mage classification refers to the task of extracting information classes from a multiband raster image. 
The resulting raster from image classification can be used to create thematic maps. Depending on the interaction between the 
analyst and the computer during classification, there are two types of classification: supervised and unsupervised.

Convolutional Neural Networks come under the subdomain of Machine Learning which is Deep Learning. 
Algorithms under Deep Learning process information the same way the human brain does, 
but obviously on a very small scale, since our brain is too complex (our brain has around 86 billion neurons).



Step by Step Guide

Step 1: Choose a Dataset

Step 2: Prepare Dataset for Training

Step 3: Create Training Data

Step 4: Shuffle the Dataset

Step 5: Assigning Labels and Features

Step 6: Normalising X and converting labels to categorical data

Step 7: Split X and Y for use in CNN

Step 8: Define, compile and train the CNN Model

Step 9: Accuracy and Score of model
